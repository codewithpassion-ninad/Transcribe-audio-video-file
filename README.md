# Transcribe-audio-video-file
In the repository, there's a Colab notebook that showcases my use of the AssemblyAI API to create a transcription bot.
The API implementation involves several steps.
Firstly, the API key must be initialized.
Secondly, it requires the installation of Pytube from YouTube.
The third stage involves obtaining the YouTube or Drive video link, which will then be converted to an audio file.
This audio file can then be used as input to generate the transcript via a model. 
Once the transcript file is generated, it will be displayed to the user.
Finally, the user will be prompted for their preference on whether to download the transcript file or not.
